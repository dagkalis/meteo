# Meteo application

This platform connects to the **Open-Meteo** weather API (open-meteo.com) to display weather-related information, ensuring you get hourly temperature forecasts.

Behind the scenes, the app uses the **Ruby on Rails** framework and the **Reach JavaScript Library** to make sure everything runs seamlessly.

Here's what the app offers:

- **Easy Sign-Up:** Get started by creating an account.
- **Profile Upload:** Upload your resume during sign-up to unlock data access.
- **Secure Access:** Log in to use the application.
- **Location-Based Data:** The weather forecast is specific to the user's location using the **JavaScript Geolocation API**
- **Clear Presentation:** View data in a user-friendly interface. The application offers two ways to visualize data:
  - Line charts using Google Charts
  - Raw data presented in a table format
- **Save Your Findings:** Store data for future reference in the "Stored Weather Data" section.
- **Stay Organized:** Delete stored data when needed.
- **Personalize Your Profile:** Edit your profile details and change your password.
